Please put your images in here. This isn't the actual folder to access images, it's just a way to keep track of the images that we are using in the website.

You will need to put another copy of your images in the images folder found in the public folder within client for it to actually display on the website

An example would look like this: 
<!-- <img src="/images/name-of-image.png"> -->
No need to put in public or whatever, just change 'name-of-image' to the actual image name and you're good to go!
