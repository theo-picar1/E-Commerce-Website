            "The Gibson Les Paul Standard 50s AAA guitarguitar Exclusive has been designed with the intention of grouping together the features that typify this period for Gibson. Without being a specific vintage reissue, this model will deliver a definitive Les Paul experience!", 
            "The body of this model has zero weight relief, a bonus for Les Paul aficionados, some who believe the drill holes used by Gibson to remove the heft of a solid mahogany body, take with them some of the tone. Gibson have listened to those who are after a 'full fat' Les Paul and have delivered exactly that."
